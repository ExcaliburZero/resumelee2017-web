# Résumélee 2017
This is Christopher Wells' entry for the BSides RoC's 2017 Résumélee competition.

## Description
I have taken my resume, encrypted it, and broken it up into pieces. In order to get a copy of it you must find each of the pieces, put them back together and decrypt them.

In order to make it easier to find the resume parts, I have given you a terminal interface that you can use to locate them. However, you will have to be able to answer some questions in order to learn where the peices are located.

(If you don't feel like answering the questions, there are some \*other\* ways to find the pieces, certainly don't look at `output.js`)

Once you have gathered all of the pieces, you will need to piece them back together and decrypt them. I will provide you with a program that will do this, and the password.

(You could try doing this without the program for a more interesting challenge, be sure not to look at the \*source code on GitHub\*)

## Terminal
The locations of the file parts are hidden in files in the terminal. The terminal has support for several different commands, including `cd` ,`ls`, and `cat`. Enter `help` to see a full list of supported commands.

The terminal directories contain questions that you must answer. Each answer corresponds to a subdirectory that you can enter to move onto the next question or get a part file location.

Look out for fake file parts if you get a question wrong. Some wrong answers are dead-ends, while others will give convincing fake file parts.
