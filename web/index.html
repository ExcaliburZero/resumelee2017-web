<p>This is Christopher Wells' entry for the BSides RoC's 2017 Résumélee competition.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>I have taken my resume, encrypted it, and broken it up into pieces. In order to get a copy of it you must find each of the pieces, put them back together and decrypt them.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier to find the resume parts, I have given you a terminal interface that you can use to locate them. However, you will have to be able to answer some questions in order to learn where the peices are located.</p>
<p>(If you don't feel like answering the questions, there are some *other* ways to find the pieces, certainly don't look at <code>output.js</code>)</p>
<p>Once you have gathered all of the pieces, you will need to piece them back together and decrypt them. I will provide you with a program that will do this, and the password.</p>
<p>(You could try doing this without the program for a more interesting challenge, be sure not to look at the *source code on GitHub*)</p>
